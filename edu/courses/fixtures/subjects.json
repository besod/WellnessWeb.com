    "overview": "Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics, race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history, and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch and play.  It's the new and improved version of Professor Orin Starn's original \"Sports and Society\" for Coursera, which drew more than 40,000 students.  We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,” as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing.  You will never watch or think about sports in the same way again.",

The growing understanding of how hunger and weight \"set point\" are regulated is changing the way we need to approach weight loss. This week, we will see how the brain, hormones, gut, and emotions interact to control food intake and weight. By learning about our biology, and how to work with rather than against it, you will become more successful at reaching your goals.\r\n3 videos\r\n4 readings\r\n1 quiz"
